# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to `valide`.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Open an [issue](https://github.com/haisi/valide/issues) with a minimal repro for bugs, or a
short description of the use case for feature requests.

## Making changes

1. Fork the repo and create a branch off `main`.
2. Build and test:
   ```shell
   ./mvnw verify
   ```
3. Keep the change focused. If you're proposing something larger (a new public API, a new dependency), open
   an issue first to discuss the approach before writing code.
4. Formatting, Checkstyle, Error Prone/NullAway, and 100% test coverage are all enforced by `verify` — run
   `./mvnw spotless:apply` to auto-format code and `pom.xml` before committing.
5. Open a pull request against `main` describing the change and why it's needed. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   runs the build and test suite on every PR.

## Releasing

Releases are cut by a maintainer by pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag — see the [Releasing](README.md#releasing) section
of the README. Contributors don't need to worry about versioning or publishing.
